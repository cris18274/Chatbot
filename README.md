# Chatbot
Creating an AI Chatbot in Python involves several steps. In this example, we will use the `ChatterBot` library to create a basic chatbot that can answer general questions.

You can install the `ChatterBot` library using `pip` by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install chatterbot

In this example, we first imported the `ChatBot` class and the `ChatterBotCorpusTrainer` class from the `chatterbot` library. Then we created a new chatbot and a trainer for the chatbot.

We trained the chatbot based on the English corpus using the `train()` method of the trainer. The English corpus contains thousands of pre-defined conversations that the chatbot can learn from.

Finally, we started a conversation with the chatbot using a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, we took the user's input and generated a response from the chatbot using the `get_response()` method of the chatbot. The conversation continues until the user exits the program by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
